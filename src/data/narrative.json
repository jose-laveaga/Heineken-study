  "abstract": "This executive brief summarizes a 2025 experimental study on how sustainable cues, pack formats, and price context influence non-alcoholic beer selection across key shopper segments. The report synthesizes preference shares, sentiment feedback, and discrepancy analysis to guide portfolio and messaging strategy.",
  "context": [
    "Heineken is a global brewery producing beer for distribution across 192 countries, with its origins dating back to 1873. As one of the world’s leading beer brands, Heineken operates through an extensive network of production facilities and logistics systems that must continuously adapt to changes in consumer behavior. Shifts in consumption, especially among younger and health-conscious segments, play a significant role in determining production planning, inventory strategy, and long-term market positioning.",
    "In 2013, Heineken joined the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, signaling a commitment to reducing harmful drinking alongside other major alcohol brands. Around the same period, the availability of non alcoholic beers began to expand rapidly. These emerging products disrupted the traditional alcohol market, prompting established breweries to diversify their offerings in response to evolving consumer preferences. Heineken entered this space in 2017 with the launch of Heineken 0.0, a non-alcoholic version of its flagship beer, marking a key strategic move into the growing zero-alcohol category.",
    "The broader beverage landscape now includes a wide range of non-alcoholic options offered by both established parent brands that also produce alcoholic beverages and by dedicated companies specializing exclusively in non-alcoholic products. Existing research suggests that increasing the availability of non alcoholic drinks can lower alcohol consumption, but there remains a limited understanding of how consumers respond when established alcohol brands introduce non alcoholic extensions. In particular, little is known about whether a strong mother brand enhances consumer acceptance of its zero alcohol variant and how this effect varies across different consumer segments.",
    "The current research aims to address this gap by evaluating the influence of Heineken’s branding on perceptions and preferences for non alcoholic beer. The focus is on determining whether the strength of the Heineken mother brand plays a significant role in promoting Heineken 0.0 and whether this effect differs for consumers who regularly consume alcohol compared to those who do not.",
    "This project uses a mixed-method research design that combines a controlled laboratory experiment, a field experiment, questionnaires, and qualitative interviews. These methods produce primary data that will be supplemented with secondary data from Heineken. Together, the findings are expected to provide actionable insights for marketing strategy, product positioning, and consumer behavior analysis, supporting Heineken’s efforts to expand its presence in the zero-alcohol market and to better understand broader patterns of non-alcoholic beverage adoption."
