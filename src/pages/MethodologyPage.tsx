                            The study uses a within-subject experimental design in which each participant completes a simulated e-commerce
                            shopping task featuring Heineken 0.0, a fictional non-branded 0.0 beer, and selected real-world 0.0 beer options.
                            Presenting branded and non-branded alternatives within the same decision environment enables within-person
                            comparison of choice behavior and perceived value, supporting identification of brand effects under controlled
                            conditions.

                        <p>
                            The inclusion of a fictional, non-branded 0.0 beer provides a zero-familiarity baseline and reduces confounding
                            from pre-existing brand perceptions. This approach enables tighter control over product attributes and isolates
                            the incremental impact of mother-brand equity on purchase decisions in the non-alcoholic category. The design
                            incorporates multiple brand and price scenarios to evaluate how brand equity interacts with economic tradeoffs in
                            a realistic shopping context.

                        <p>
                            Participants were exposed to repeated brand-choice comparisons that juxtaposed mother brands (e.g., Heineken,
                            Budweiser, Beck’s Blue) with fictional, leading, and lesser-known non-mother brand alternatives. A subset of
                            Heineken comparisons included systematic price manipulations (equal, higher, or lower price relative to a fictional
                            alternative) to test whether brand equity persists under unfavorable price conditions. For 12-pack scenarios,
                            Heineken’s price was held constant across comparisons to improve interpretability of relative substitution patterns.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Following each selection, the shopping cart was automatically cleared to ensure that participants faced a
                            fresh comparison in every scenario, thereby eliminating potential carryover effects across decisions.
                            Comparison order and product placement were randomized to mitigate order effects and position-related bias.
                            Randomization reduces the likelihood that fatigue, learning, anchoring, or spatial preferences systematically
                            influence results, strengthening internal validity and improving attribution of observed behavioral differences to
                            the manipulated factors.
