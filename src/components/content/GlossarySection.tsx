  {
    term: 'Alternative hypothesis',
    definition:
        'Posits that an effect or association exists between the variables under study. Evidence inconsistent with the null hypothesis provides support for the alternative hypothesis.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Central tendency',
    definition:
        'A summary measure of the typical value of a distribution (e.g., the mean or median), used to compare location across groups.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Coefficient',
    definition:
        'An estimated parameter in a statistical model representing the direction and magnitude of association between a predictor and the outcome, conditional on other covariates.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Confidence interval (CI)',
    definition:
        'An interval estimate that quantifies uncertainty around a parameter or statistic (commonly 95%). Narrower intervals indicate greater precision.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Correlation',
    definition:
        'A measure of linear association between two variables. Positive values indicate that higher values of one variable tend to be associated with higher values of the other; negative values indicate the opposite.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Distribution',
    definition:
        'The pattern of values a variable takes, including its spread, shape, and central tendency.'
  },

    term: 'Hypothesis',
    definition:
        'A testable statement about a relationship or difference between variables that is evaluated using data.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Logistic regression',
    definition:
        'A regression model for a binary outcome that estimates the probability of the outcome as a function of predictor variables; results are commonly summarized using coefficients and odds ratios.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Marginal means (predicted margins)',
    definition:
        'Model-based expected outcomes for specified groups or covariate values, typically averaged over (or standardized to) the distribution of other covariates.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Median',
    definition:
        'The 50th percentile of an ordered set of values; half the observations are above and half are below.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Null hypothesis',
    definition:
        'Posits no effect or association between variables. The p-value assesses the extent to which the observed data are compatible with this hypothesis.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Odds ratio',
    definition:
        'A ratio comparing the odds of an outcome under two conditions or groups. In logistic regression, it corresponds to the multiplicative change in odds associated with a one-unit increase in a predictor (or relative to a reference category), holding other variables constant.'
  },
  {
    term: 'P-value',
    definition:
        'The probability, under the null hypothesis, of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, according to the test statistic.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Predicted probability',
    definition:
        'A model-based estimate of the probability that an outcome occurs for a given set of predictor values.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Quartile',
    definition:
        'Cut points that divide an ordered distribution into four equal parts (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles).'
  },
  {
    term: 'Sample size',
    definition:
        'The number of observations included in an analysis. Larger samples generally yield more precise estimates, all else equal.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Statistical significance',
    definition:
        'A decision criterion indicating that an effect is unlikely to be explained by sampling variability alone, given a pre-specified threshold (e.g., α = 0.05). Statistical significance does not imply practical importance.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Stratified sample',
    definition:
        'A probability sampling design in which the population is partitioned into non-overlapping strata based on shared characteristics, and samples are drawn within each stratum.'
  },
  {
    term: 'Variance',
    definition:
        'A measure of dispersion equal to the average squared deviation from the mean; larger values indicate greater spread.'
